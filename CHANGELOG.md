[#119]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run/pull/119

### Fixed

- [#117] wait for breakpoint before switching RTT from non-blocking mode to blocking mode.

## [v0.1.5] - 2020-11-20

- [#106] `probe-run` now reports the program size

- [#259] building the crates.io version of `probe-run` no longer depends on the `git` command line tool (fixed [#256])
- [#264] `probe-run` doesn't panic if log message is not UTF-8
